# FashionAIApp🩷​​✨​🛍️👗👛​​🫶​

Idea: A macOS app built with SwiftUI that uses AI (LLMs) to generate outfit ideas, makeup suggestions, and more. I know this idea has already been implemented by other people, but this is just a fun project for me to get more familiar with AI and Swift! 

## Features
TBD (want to be able to generate outfit ideas (and potentially some other categories) using one (or multiple) of OpenAI's LLMs / APIs, and save these into folders)

## Tech Stack
- Swift + SwiftUI
- SwiftData (for local storage) - TODO
- OpenAI API (LLM integration)
- macOS native app (Xcode)

## Setup
TBD

## Resources used
-

## To Do
- Think of potential designs and templates for app, and themes
- Enable folder tagging?
- Improve LLM prompt customization?
- Potentially later on figure out image generation, but for the base of the app I just want to focus on integration of APIs and developing the app in Swift
